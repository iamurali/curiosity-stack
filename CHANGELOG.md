# Changelog

All notable changes to the Curiosity Stack plugin are documented here.

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-03-24

### Rebuilt — India Proxy Agent

Complete rewrite of the India Proxy Agent. Same command, radically
deeper output.

- Sub-segment decomposition before every search
- 4-tier source hierarchy: analyst coverage (KuppingerCole, Gartner,
  Forrester, IDC, Omdia) → India registries (NASSCOM, DPIIT, DSCI,
  GEM, CERT-In) → 11 seeded VC portfolios → specialist publications
- Emerging segment detection
- Name currency checks (known rebrands: Aujas → NuSummit,
  EduGorilla → Infobay AI)
- SME exchange awareness (NSE Emerge / BSE SME correctly labelled)
- Corrected flagging logic — never flag for obscurity
- Structured 3-column table output always: Sub-segment | Global | India
- Inline SEBI disclaimer on every run

### Added — Domain Knowledge skill

- `/curiosity-stack:knowledge` command
- Personal company registry scoped per sector
- Post-agent inline add form
- Seeded vs Discovered labels in output
- local.md extended with domain_knowledge section

### Fixed — Layer card design restored

- Full CSS block with stat cards, cause grid, vc-table, insight
  callouts, company pills, progress bar, A/A+/A++ toggle
- Layer header always #1b5e52 — never inherits scenario category colour
- HTML fragment format enforced — no DOCTYPE/html/head/body tags

### Fixed — Welcome agent

- Welcome now responds as plain text in chat
- 6 topic suggestions, no artifact, no loading time

---

## [3.2.6] — 2026-03-23

### Added — Watchlist UI
- **Interactive watchlist manager** — no more raw YAML shown to users.
  Watchlist now renders as a clean two-tab HTML artifact:
  - Topics tab: collapsible cards per topic, inline trigger add/remove,
    cadence selector, save button with confirmation
  - Schedule tab: Gmail status, day-of-week selector, next run display,
    trigger alert count, YAML generator (last step, not first)
- **Trigger flow** — add triggers inline without typing in chat.
  UI updates immediately, YAML generated silently on save.
- **YAML only on request** — raw YAML never shown during normal flow.
  Only surfaced when user explicitly clicks "Generate YAML to save"

---

## [3.2.5] — 2026-03-23

### Added — Full regulatory disclaimer on all artifacts
- **6-section disclaimer block** adapted from best-in-class community
  output. Every artifact now carries:
  1. Not a Trade Recommendation
  2. No SEBI Registration
  3. Investment Risk
  4. Company References (names companies for analysis only)
  5. Data & Sources
  6. AI-Assisted Research (acknowledges Curiosity Stack + Claude)
- **Personalised** — replaces [USER NAME] with local.md value if set
- **Non-India variant** — replaces SEBI-specific language for
  non-India geography users
- **Dual purpose** — SEBI compliance + attribution in one block.
  The clickable "⬡ Built with Curiosity Stack →" link at the bottom
  satisfies both requirements simultaneously.

---

## [3.2.4] — 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Clickable next actions** — post-decomposition action menu items
  now fire directly into chat via sendPrompt(). Each action (generate
  value chain, save to library, add to watchlist, stress test, continue)
  triggers immediately on click. Copy-with-feedback fallback if
  sendPrompt() unavailable.

### Added
- **ATTRIBUTION.md** — dedicated attribution requirements file in
  repo root. Makes fork attribution requirements explicit and clear.
- **Attribution headers** — every skill file now carries a header
  comment: curiositystack.app URL, GitHub link, MIT license notice.
  Hard to strip accidentally on forks.

---

## [3.2.3] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed — Scenario library UX
- **Start decomposition fires directly** — sendPrompt() is now the
  primary action. Clicking "Start decomposition" sends the topic
  directly into the chat. No copying, no pasting.
- **Fallback with clear feedback** — if sendPrompt() is unavailable,
  the button shows "✓ Prompt copied — paste into chat" for 3 seconds
  so the user knows it worked.
- **Removed "Copy prompt" as primary label** — button always says
  "Start decomposition →". Copy behaviour is fallback only.
- **Manual copy box** — if clipboard API also fails, a pre-filled
  textarea appears for manual selection and copy.

---

## [3.2.2] — 2026-03-22

### Fixed — Adoption and launch experience
- **Welcome agent rewritten** — scenario library now renders automatically
  on first launch as an interactive card grid. User clicks a topic and
  the decomposition starts immediately. No commands needed on first session.
- **Progressive disclosure** — commands no longer shown upfront. Each
  feature surfaces contextually after relevant outputs:
  - India Proxy Agent prompt appears after L5
  - Save / Watchlist / Research Brief options appear after full decomposition
  - Library prompt appears after 3+ sessions
- **Setup is now optional** — first session works with defaults.
  Setup prompt offered but never blocks the experience.
- **Framework skill updated** — activates on any topic description,
  not just explicit commands. Renders layer cards progressively.
  Mini summary cards after L2 and L4.

---

## [3.2.1] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Scenario Library** (`skills/scenario-library/SKILL.md`) — 18 pre-built decomposition topics across 6 categories. Solves the blank slate problem for new users. Interactive HTML card browser with search, category filter, preview panel (shows all 6 layer previews before committing), and one-click launch into the full decomposition flow.
- **`/curiosity-stack:scenarios`** command — launches the scenario browser
- **Welcome message updated** — "Not sure what to decompose first? → /curiosity-stack:scenarios"

### Categories (16 scenarios total)
- 🇮🇳 Indian Business Sectors: Semiconductor packaging, Defence manufacturing, GCC opportunity, Pharma API
- 🌍 Geopolitics: Middle East → oil, Russia-Ukraine → energy, US-China tariffs, Taiwan risk

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Decomposition Library** (`skills/decomposition-library/SKILL.md`) — saves every completed decomposition as a structured local file in `library/`. Topic, date, all 6 layer summaries, sources cited, tags, conviction placeholder. Retrieval: plugin checks library at start of new decomposition and asks if user wants to load a past session on the same topic. Optional mirror to Google Drive or Notion.
- **`/curiosity-stack:library`** command — browse, search, open, and delete saved decompositions
- **Watchlist Tracker + Trigger Alerts** (`skills/watchlist-tracker/SKILL.md`) — scheduled monitoring agent. Runs on user-set cadence (daily / weekly / fortnightly). Monitors all watchlist topics for news, regulatory changes, new entrants, and funding. Maps findings to value chain layers. Scores materiality HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW with reasoning. Trigger alerts fire when specific layer conditions are met.
- **Watchlist Agent** (`agents/watchlist-agent.md`) — autonomous agent powering the tracker. Uses web_search and web_fetch. Checks cadence before running. Delivers digest via Gmail (default) and surfaces summary in Cowork.
- **Email digest delivery** — watchlist digest sent directly to user's Gmail on cadence. Subject line prefixed with 🚨 if triggers fired. Includes Cowork deep link.
- **`/curiosity-stack:watchlist`** command — manage watchlist topics, set triggers, configure cadence and email settings
- **Source Credibility** (`skills/source-credibility/SKILL.md`) — personal source registry. Tracks which publications, databases, and analysts are cited at which layer and sector. Post-session rating prompt (max 3 sources, 60 seconds). Plugin-suggested ratings based on usage patterns after 5+ decompositions. Surfaces top-rated sources at L1 and L5 automatically.
- **`library/` folder** — local storage for decomposition files. Includes README.md placeholder.
- **Setup extended** — three new sections (Steps 6-8): decomposition library preferences, watchlist monitoring configuration, source credibility settings.
- **`curiosity-stack.local.md` extended** — new fields for library, watchlist monitoring, and source credibility.

### Changed
- `skills/setup/SKILL.md` — extended from 7 steps to 9 steps with new configuration sections

## [3.0.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Autonomous India Proxy Agent** (`agents/india-proxy-agent.md`) — `/curiosity-stack:india-proxy` now runs a full autonomous research sequence: searches Tracxn, Inc42, Screener.in, and NASSCOM, validates candidates against red flag criteria, and returns a structured shortlist with proxy pattern, access method, validation signals, and watch triggers
- **SEBI Disclaimer Hook** (`hooks/hooks.json`) — automatically appends full SEBI disclaimer to every research output at the `Stop` event; cannot be suppressed
- **`curiosity-stack.local.md`** — personal context file; users fill it once and the plugin reads it on every session; covers context, geography, themes, watchlist, sectors to deprioritise, output preference, and free-text notes
- **Customisation section in README** — three customisation paths documented: local.md editing, skill file editing, and adding custom skills
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file
- **`LICENSE`** — MIT

### Changed
- `curiosity-framework/SKILL.md` — session flow now starts with Step 0: silently read `local.md` and apply user context before intake
- `company-discovery/SKILL.md` — India proxy patterns now framed explicitly as research directions with category examples; no specific company names as illustrative examples
- `sebi-compliance/SKILL.md` — added "Naming Companies — Framing Rules" section with explicit required and forbidden language when surfacing company names at Layer 5
- `commands/india-proxy.md` — updated to route to the autonomous agent
